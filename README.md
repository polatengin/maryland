# What is Linux Kernel Module?

Linux Kernel Modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system.

It's possible to write drivers for devices that aren't supported by the kernel, or to add new system calls, or even to add support for a different filesystems.
